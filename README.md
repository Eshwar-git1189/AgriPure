## 📌 Problem Statement

Farmers often rely on:

* local suggestions

## 🧠 Solution

The system maps soil parameters and crop inputs to appropriate fertilizers using a predefined knowledge base and rule-matching logic.

Users simply:

1. Select crop
2. Enter conditions
3. Receive fertilizer recommendations
